##  Attack on Titan trivia
This is a trivia game to test the players knowledge on some attack on titan lore. After getting the right answer the score will inrease by one.
## Technologies used 
## JavaSCript 
- is responsible for the functionality of the entire game, allowing for the questions to appear, the choices for the answer, comparing the values of the selected answer to the value of the answer set in the array. Hiding and shpwing the next button and so much more.
## HTML
- will display the structure of the application
## CSS 
- the CSS i did was fairly simple. I manage to set a specific font to closely match the font style of the series.  
## Getting Started
1. Once player chooses an answer a next button feature will display on the UI allowing the user to go to the next question.
2. Upon completion, the results will display allowing the user to see their score.
